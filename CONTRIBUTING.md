# Pull Requests

When creating a pull-request you should:

- Open an issue first to confirm that the change or feature will be accepted
- Lint your code with `gofmt`, `golint`, and `govet`
- Squash multiple commits into a single commit via `git rebase -i`
- Ensure your commit message starts with a verb such as "add", "fix", "refactor", "remove"
- Ensure that your commit message references the issue with ". Closes #N"
