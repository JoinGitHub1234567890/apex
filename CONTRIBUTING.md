# How to contribute

For the most part nothing special, use `gofmt`, `golint`, and `go vet` before issuing a pull-request. Unless your pull-request contains several descrete changes, it should be rebased (using `rebase -i` or similar) into a single commit. The commit message should start with a lowercase verb such as "fix", "refactor", "add", "remove", and so on. If you're unsure about the format just look at our existing commits. If a commit references an open issue on GitHub make sure to add ". Closes #N".

That is all!
